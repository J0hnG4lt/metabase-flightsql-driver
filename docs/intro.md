# Introduction to metabase-flightsql-driver

Run this command:

```bash
podman compose up --build
```

## Connection

If you have run the docker-compose file, a service that relies on [Spice AI](https://spiceai.org/docs/api/arrow-flight-sql) should be available.

When Metabase is finally up, you can add a connection to that service

The next time you run this, you donÂ´t need to build the everything from scratch:

```bash
podman compose up
```

After this, given that you have created a database and its configuration should be stored, you should see a log like this:

## Database sync

To speed up the process and ensure that you can see all tables on Spice AI, run a database sync
